# IKEA-Inventory-Management-System
In the IKEA project, we expect to develop a system for managing a product warehouse called "IKEA." The system will include a data structure containing relevant information for inventory management, including the product's name, unique identification number, unit of measurement, and personalized information for each product. The system will support functions for adding, deleting, and modifying products in the warehouse and managing customer orders. Orders can include multiple products with varying quantities, and it will also be possible to perform the stages of order creation, addition, and shipment. Thus, the system will provide an efficient tool for inventory management and order management in an efficient and personalized manner.
